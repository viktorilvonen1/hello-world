# hello-world
My first repository

what's up!
My name is Viktor, 20years old and i like many programming languages, but haven't mastered them all yet haha... 

I'm currently studying on my own but my goal is to go to college and learn more deep, specialize into app-development.
I don't mind to learn other other languages at college tho. I'll take what i get whatever path it will be, but i will learn as much as i can! =)
